# Dev Notes

## TODO

- Detect security settings in browser to ensure JavaScript can run (e.g. Firefox "strict" mode, instead of 'standard' mode prevents the teacher tools from working)
- Get teacher resources working again

## .astro or .mdx

Use `.astro` for building interactive components or apps.

Use `.mdx` for text/image-heavy blog posts, or content that non-technical team members need to contribute to

## Bespoke Materials

Find your grammar level
(use that yellow grammar book from work with the questions at the beginning that increase in difficulty)

[JS] learn, revise target vocab for each week
[JS] Convert paper worksheet activities into a click&move format for the site

LSCWCx5 and OW/NW for spelling

I know some English. I can talk about my family. I can talk about my job or school. I can talk about my likes and dislikes.

I know more English and want to continue learning. I know some more complex grammar and I can read, write and speak in English.

Intermediate (B1)
I've been learning English for a few years now and I feel comfortable talking with native speakers. My grammar skills are pretty good, but I need to improve my vocabulary and pronunciation.

Upper Intermediate (B2)
I'm basically fluent in English. I'm keen to better understand how native speakers use the language, such as idioms and cultural references.
