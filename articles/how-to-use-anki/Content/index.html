<h2 id="what-is-anki">What is Anki?</h2>
<p>In Anki, a ‘card’ refers to a digital version of a paper flashcard, featuring a question-and-answer pair. Unlike physical flashcards, the question remains visible when the answer is revealed. For example, in studying basic chemistry, a question like “What is the chemical symbol for oxygen?” would display “O” upon revealing the answer. Users then inform Anki about their recall level, influencing the scheduling of future reviews.</p>
<p>Decks in Anki are designed to categorise content into broad study areas like English or Geography. While it might seem appealing to create many small decks for detailed organisation, such as “my geography book chapter 1” or “food verbs,” this approach is generally discouraged. If you sequentially review each deck/topic, you’ll likely encounter related content together, like all “chapter 1” or “food verb” cards. This contextual cue can make it easier to guess answers, resulting in weaker memory formation. Effective recall in real-world situations demands retrieving information without such contextual hints.</p>
