# Passing the river at Woogaroo Reach

Yesterday, I visited the Queensland Art Gallery and I felt engaged by a painting made with **oil on canvas** by Anne Wallace. Its name is **Passing the river at Woogaroo Reach**. My first impression was that the paint wanted to show how humans should behave with nature. Their faces were showing me fear, respect and admiration about the forest. The striking colour of the bush and of the snake emphasizes the power of nature and for that reason we should jasy admire it and not believe that it belongs to us.

Besides, Myu saw a dangerous forest when tourists were on holidays and they also felt scared about nature, However what the artist really wanted to represent was really far from our idea.

The picture depicts the moment when people, who are admitted into a psychiatric hospital located in a forest in Woogaroo, go out after a long time. Their expressions show the fear that they may feel and the mattress represents the hard life that they could be living again outside for them.

In my opinion the artist should adds more striking colours to the house as she used in the snake and the bush to give more attention to what she really wants to show.
