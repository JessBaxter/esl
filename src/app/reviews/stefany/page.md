## Name of Artwork/Exhibit:

Lightning 1998

## Artist’s Name:

Kumantje Jagamara

## Medium:

Synthetic polymer paint on linen canvas

## Located at:

Queensland Art Gallery (QAG)

## Brief Description:

The painting was a radical departure from his more traditional Western Desert style painting.
The artist used vibrant colour.

## First Impressions:

I liked this colourful art but I think that it is a **complex and abstract painting**.

## Feelings:

Thoughtful

## Questions:

Why did Jagamara use vibrant colours in his paintings?

## What I liked/Didn’t like and why?

I liked that used vibrant magenta lines to signify bolts of lightning, a natural phenomenon that is associated with one of the many Dreaming stories of which the **Warlpiri\*/Luritja** was custodian. Jamagara **was an Aboriginal Australian Painter**.

\* Walpiri – Area of the Northern Territory of Australia.

## Include Others Opinion

### Interviewee’s Name:

Miyu

### Their Thoughts:

Miyu told me that her favorite painting is **Lightning 1998**, because it is **similar to an onsen symbol**. Onsen is a Japanese symbol that **means natural hot water**. In Japan, onsen are hot springs and the bathing facilities and traditional inns around them. The presence of an onsen is often indicated on signs and maps by the symbol:
