_ARTIST:_ BENITA CLEMES

QUEENSLAND ART GALLERY

_This is an artwork that represent the impact of globalization upon indigenous communities_

_My First impression about this artwork was how the globalization has affected Indigenous cultures, here in Australia and the rest of the world, causing the loss of our true aborigines and the pollution of our planet_

_it gives me a sensation that we have ruined our planet with capitalism_

_I would like to know what the indigenous think about this topic_

_In conversation with some people_

People are not very interested in that type of topics People think its not very important
However they think that the artwork is beautiful for the colors

_REMEMBER_

The artworks are very important because they Keep millions of stories that endure through time.

So museums are a place that everyone likes to visit

_ADVICE_

Its always good to learn and educate yourself

_Thanks_
