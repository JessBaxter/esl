## Dark Necessities

Yesterday i was **The Queensland Art Gallery** it was so exciting the whole museum is a fantastic journey. But there is one painting that especially engaged me. Its name is **Connecting threads (Beginning)** and it was created by **Wendy Stravrianos** using the medium of canvas.

It's a large painting, approximately two metres on each side is this painting black and white colors predominate. It has very defined line as if they were blueprint designs. The painting looks like a city in chaos with pollution where every day is dark. A dystopic place is waiting for its buildings to fall.

I asked Jim, he is a classmate, about the painting and he told me that its _look like changes of era, revolution, science and industry_.

In conclusion this pieces of art is fabulous i think the artist wants to show how the development of large cities can be dark and chaotic for those who live in them.
