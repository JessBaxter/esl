### Technique: Hand-cut digital photographs archival tape

I visited for the first time Queensland Art Gallery and I particulary liked one piece of art with a lot of images.
This piece of art has some interestinf characteristics. Is big, its form is circular and is like a mandala. The artist used a _compilation of images of protesters from around the world_. They wear very colorful clothes and masks.
It stands out because is colorful and is eye-catching in the room. I was impressed first of all by the different colors and its form, that caught my attention. Then I looked more closely and I saw different people with masks. Was interesting because you can spend time analyzing colors, forms, patterns and what it represents.
I like the mandalas so I felt a sense of curiosity for the forms and colors. Also, I asked myself about what kind of group is protesting? Why they wear masks all time? Why they are in nature? They can´t talk? What the colors mean?
Overall, I like the piece and its representation. I really like as the images inside manage to capture your attention and it takes you to read the description to understand more the context. For me the colors are power and stand out. The only thing I didn´t like was some people it could be overwhelming to see people with masks everywhere, because you never see their faces.
I discussed the feelings and perspective with _Miyu_ who said: “Its interesting but a little bit scary, also its colorful” then she thought maybe they try to express something but she doesn’t understand the reason. She seemed interested in the patterns of the piece. After reading the description, she commented: “They express the power, became big power”  
According to a fellow visitor, Peter, he remarked that piece is colorful, Its shape is that of a flower and is interesting by represent “Protests” but he ask himself: What kind of protest? What is the reason? \_He concluded That piece is attractive for the people.
After reading the description and analyzing it a little one thing that stands out is the power of the union to be heard. I liked the visit to Art Gallery since you find interesting exhibitions, It’s also constructive if you like to discuss your perspectives with others. _I would recommend visiting this gallery to people who like history and modern art._
