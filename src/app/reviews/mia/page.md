# Lesson from magazine "LIFE"

## Brief Description

This photo was a cover picture of the magazine "LIFE". A man is passionately kissing a nurse. By the way, they didn't know each other. The man-a sailor- just kissed to a passing woman with the joy of the end of the World War 2.

## First impression & Feeling & Questions

First impression of the picture was romantic feelings. It's also a monochrome photography, it makes the photo to give even more romantic feelings. But I felt it's kinda romantic but weird as well. Because of the attitude of the nurse in the photo, she looks not very pleasant. So, there's a question. There's lots of people in the picture, but how did they kiss just in front of the photographer by chance?

## Stefany's Thoughts

- Shows the love, hope and happiness
- Representative of the love, hope and happiness
- Woman's attitude : She loves him & thinking 'It's a funny situation'
- Obviously he loves her

## Conclusion & Recommendation

"Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot."

I strongly recommend to see this picture for letting know about the real story about the picture.
