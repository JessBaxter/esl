## Reading Practice

Here are three articles that fit into this week's theme. Start with the **B1: Intermediate** article and complete those activities. Once you've done that, try the **B2: Upper Intermediate** and **C1: Advanced** readings.

_If you try the **B2** and **C1** articles and find them to be too challenging, use that same site to practise **B1** reading on a daily basis._
