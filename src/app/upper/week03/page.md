While on the topic of science and technology, we're going to conduct a class debate on a variety of related topics. Each of you will have the opportunity to participate and practise persuasive speaking.

## How do we research a debate topic?

Being able to back up your claims with reputable sources is a key skill in winning any argument. In today's world where it's becoming increasingly more difficult to be able to determine fact from fiction (in part due to the accessibility of AI-generated content), knowing that the information you have can be trusted is vital.
