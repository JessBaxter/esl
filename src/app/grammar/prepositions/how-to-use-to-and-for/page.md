Prepositions like "to" and "for" are foundational, yet they often pose challenges due to their versatile applications. Let's dive deeper into their uses with examples to help you grasp their functions better.

## When to use 'to'

### The fundamentals

Use the preposition 'to' for indicating movement towards a destination, not limited to physical movement but also including transfers or reaching a point. Examples include taking the bus to work, talking to a doctor, or running to the shops. 'To' is also used to express distances, such as from a house to the office.

For time, 'to' marks the span between two points, like a quarter to seven or the hours a supermarket is open. It's used for periods, from one time to another, like studying English from Monday to Thursday.

When comparing preferences, 'to' shows a preference for one thing over another, like preferring chocolate ice cream to vanilla.

Lastly, 'to' denotes a limit or endpoint, such as water reaching up to your knees. The key uses of 'to' involve direction or destination, time spans, preferences, and limits or endpoints.

### Direction or Destination

_Every morning, I walk **to** the train station to catch my train **to** the city._

**Some notes about this sentence:**

- The first 'to' ("walk to the train station") indicates _direction or destination_.
- The second 'to' ("to catch my train") is part of _an infinitive verb phrase_ ('to catch'), which expresses purpose or intent. Here, it explains why the subject walks to the train station.
- The third 'to' ("train to the city") again indicates _direction or destination_, showing where the train is going.

### Time

_I need to finish this report by a quarter **to** five because the meeting starts at five sharp._

### Preference

_Given the choice, I always prefer tea **to** coffee; it's just more refreshing to me._

**Some notes about this sentence:**

- The 'to' in "prefer tea to coffee" indicates _preference_, comparing tea against coffee and showing the speaker's favour towards tea.
- The 'to' in "refreshing to me" is part of _a different construction_ that relates to the recipient of an action or feeling. In this case, it's used to indicate whom the action (the refreshing quality) is directed towards or affects ('me').

### Limit or Endpoint

_The garden stretches up **to** the edge of the river, providing a beautiful view of the water._

### Distance

_It's about three miles from my home **to** the library, a perfect distance for a morning jog._

## When to use 'for'

### The fundamentals

The preposition "for" has several key uses in English. It indicates benefits, such as in "Ginger is great for your immune system," highlighting the positive outcomes of an action or condition. It's also used to denote time duration, applicable in sentences like "They’ve been living in the city for three years," where it describes the length of an ongoing action.

"For" marks actions done on someone's behalf, implying assistance or a favour, as seen in "I baked a cake for my sister." Furthermore, it specifies function or purpose, evident in "It’s used for drinking," where it connects an object with its use.

A nuanced aspect of "for" involves its interchangeability with "to" when discussing reasons or motives, with a simple rule distinguishing their use: "to" precedes verbs ("He’s studying English to apply for a job"), and "for" comes before nouns ("He’s studying English for work"). This distinction is crucial for conveying the correct meaning, especially in contexts where both "to" and "for" could alter the sentence's interpretation, as demonstrated by the difference between "My assistant brought lunch to me" and "My boss brought lunch for me."

Understanding "for" in its various contexts is less about memorisation and more about recognising collocations—word pairs that frequently occur together, making expressions sound natural. Familiarity with these common pairings is a practical approach to mastering preposition use, enhancing fluency and comprehension in English.

### Benefit

_Drinking green tea is beneficial **for** your metabolism._

### Duration

_She has worked for the company **for** over a decade._

**Some notes about this sentence:**

- The 'for' in "has worked for the company" indicates the _beneficiary_ or the entity for whom the action is performed.
- The 'for' in "for over a decade" denotes _duration_ or the length of time over which the action has been ongoing.

### Assistance

_Could you pick up some groceries **for** me on your way home?_

### Purpose

_This tool is designed **for** cutting through metal._

### Reason with 'to' and 'for'

_He's learning Spanish **to** communicate with his clients more effectively._
_He's learning Spanish **for** his upcoming trip to Argentina._

**Some notes about these sentences:**

- "To" introduces the infinitive form of a verb ("to communicate"), indicating the purpose or intention behind the action. It explains why he is learning Spanish: the motive is to achieve better communication with his clients. The use of "to" before a verb is common when expressing the reason or intention directly related to an action.
- "For" precedes a noun phrase ("his upcoming trip to Argentina"), signifying the reason or motive behind the action in terms of a noun. The learning of Spanish is intended to prepare him for a specific event or situation, which is his trip. Unlike "to," which is followed by a verb to express purpose, "for" is used with nouns or noun phrases to indicate the reason.
