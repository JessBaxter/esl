Dark Necessities.
Yesterday ~~i~~ **I** was ~~The~~ **at the** Queensland Art Gallery **, and** it was so exciting **, as** the whole museum is a fantastic journey. But there is one painting that especially ~~enganged~~ **engaged** me. Its name is Connecting ~~threads~~ **Threads** (Beginning)**,** and it was created by Wendy Stravrianos using the ~~meduim~~ **medium** of canvas.
ItÂ´s a large painting, ~~approximatly~~ **approximately** two metres on each side**. In** this painting**,** black and white colors predominate. It has very defined ~~line~~ **lines** as if they were blueprint designs.
The painting looks like a city in chaos with pollution where every day is dark. A ~~distopic~~ **dystopic** place is waiting for its buildings to fall.
I asked Jim, ~~he~~ **who** is a classmate, about the painting**,** and he told me that ~~its~~ **it** look**s** like changes of era, revolution, ~~sciens~~ **science** and industry.
In conclusion **,** this ~~pieces~~ **piece** of art is ~~faboluos~~ **fabulous, and** I think the artist wants to show how the development of large cities can be dark and chaotic for those who live in them.

**Overall Feedback:**
Great job on your piece of writing! You've done an excellent job conveying your experience and insights about the artwork at the Queensland Art Gallery. I noticed a few areas for improvement, mainly in terms of spelling, punctuation, and grammar. Paying attention to capitalisation, especially with the word "I," and the correct use of articles ("the") can greatly improve the clarity of your writing. Additionally, watch out for verb agreement ("looks" instead of "look") and the spelling of more complex words like "fabulous" and "dystopic." Keep practicing your punctuation, as commas and periods can help organise your ideas more clearly for the reader. Overall, you're making great progress, and with a bit of polishing, your writing will become even more effective. Keep up the good work!
