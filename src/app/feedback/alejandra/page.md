### Your art review

---

Yesterday, I visited the Queensland Art Gallery and I felt engaged by a painting made with oil on canvas by Anne Wallace. Its name is **"** Passing the river at Woogaroo Reach **"**. My first impression was that the paint wanted to show how humans should behave with nature. Their faces were showing me fear, respect, and admiration ~~about~~ **for** the forest. The striking colour of the bush and ~~of the~~ **the** snake emphasises the power of nature, and for that reason, we should ~~jasy~~ **just** admire it and not believe that it belongs to us.

~~Besides, Myu~~ **I sopoke with Miyu, who** saw a dangerous forest ~~when~~ **where** tourists were on holidays, ~~and~~ **but** they ~~also~~ felt scared ~~about~~ **by the** nature **around them**. However, what the artist really wanted to represent was really far from our ~~idea~~ **ideas**.

The picture depicts the moment when people, who are admitted into a psychiatric hospital located in a forest in Woogaroo, go out after a long time. Their expressions show the fear that they may feel, and the mattress represents the hard life that they could be living again outside ~~for~~ **to** them.

In my opinion, the artist should ~~adds~~ **add** more striking colours to the house **,** as she used in the snake and the bush **,** to give more attention to what she really wants to show.

**Overall Feedback:**
You've made some excellent observations about the artwork, conveying your interpretations and feelings effectively. However, let's focus on a few areas for improvement:

- Subject-Verb Agreement: Ensure that your verbs match the subject in number (singular/plural). For instance, 'the artist should add' instead of 'adds'.
- Prepositions: Pay attention to the correct prepositions for specific contexts, e.g., 'admiration for' instead of 'about'.
- Capitalisation: Remember to capitalise proper nouns and the first word of sentences for consistency and readability.
- Spelling and Typos: Be vigilant for typos that can change the meaning of your sentences or distract from your message, such as 'jasy' which should be 'just'.
- Punctuation: Use commas to separate clauses for clarity and to improve the flow of your sentences. This includes using commas before conjunctions in compound sentences and after introductory phrases.

Keep up the good work, and remember, practice makes perfect. Your ability to engage with and interpret art is commendable, and refining your writing will only enhance your ability to share your insights with others.
