Lesson from magazine "LIFE"

Brief Description

This photo was a cover picture of the magazine "LIFE". A man is passionately kissing a nurse. By the way, they didn't know each other. The man—a sailor—just ~~kissed to~~ **kissed** a passing woman with the joy of the end of World War 2.

First impression & Feeling & Questions

First impression of the picture was romantic feelings. It's also a monochrome photograph~~y~~, ~~it~~ **which** makes the photo ~~to give~~ even more romantic feelings. But I felt it's kinda romantic but weird as well. Because of the attitude of the nurse in the photo, she looks not very pleasant. So, there's a question: There's lots of people in the picture, but how did they kiss just in front of the photographer by chance?

Stefany's Thoughts

- Shows the love, hope, and happiness
- Representative of the love, hope, and happiness
- Woman's attitude: She loves him & thinking 'It's a funny situation'
- Obviously, he loves her

Conclusion & Recommendation

"Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot."

I strongly recommend ~~to see~~ **seeing** this picture ~~for letting know~~ **to learn** about the real story ~~about~~ **behind** the picture.
