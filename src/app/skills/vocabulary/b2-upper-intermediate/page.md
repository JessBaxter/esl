When it comes to remembering vocabulary, I can't impress on you enough how valuable a tool like [the Anki app](../../articles/how-to-use-anki) is. However, if you are an iPhone user, the app is a tad expensive (it's free for Android users!), so you'll want to use [the browser version](https://ankiuser.net/study) instead.

For learning new vocabulary, my favourite place is the [British Council's LearnEnglish](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/vocabulary/b1-b2-vocabulary) site. Their vocabulary section has both Intermediate and Upper Intermediate words that you should strive to learn and remember. They also have some [fun spelling games to play](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/vocabulary/vocabulary-games), if that's your thing.

Alternatively, you might like to try some [vocabulary quizzes](https://www.englishclub.com/esl-quizzes/vocabulary/), which focus on a variety of topics and range from easy to more challenging words.

Here are a few targetted topics that you should have an understanding of at the Upper Intermediate level:

| TOPIC                  | SITE                                                                       |
