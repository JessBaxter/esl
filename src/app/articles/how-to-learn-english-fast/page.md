## 1. Label Objects in Your Home

On sticky notes, write the English name for various objects around your home. Attach these notes to the objects themselves.

Placing English labels on everyday items in your home creates a language-rich environment. This method uses the principle of constant exposure, which helps in better retention of words. Seeing and using these words daily in their context reinforces your memory and understanding.

## 2. Use Anki Every Day

Review your Anki flashcards daily. Spaced repetition is a fantastic way to learn efficiently.

For effective implementation of spaced repetition, consistency in intervals and a well-planned study regimen are crucial. Balancing recall success and error rates ensures active engagement in the learning process. Persistence, even through challenging phases, is vital as it strengthens neural pathways. A distraction-free study environment complements the method, maximising learning outcomes.

Write words on pieces of paper or post-it notes, and attach them to a dedicated wall at home.

Transform your learning space with word walls. These visually engaging tools display new vocabulary along with images, aiding in retention through repeated exposure. This method integrates learning seamlessly into your everyday environment.

## 4. Use Pop Culture

Use your favourite English songs, films, or TV programmes to find new vocabulary.

Engaging with English media (like songs or movies) is an enjoyable way to learn colloquial language and idiomatic expressions. This method taps into the emotional aspect of learning, making it more memorable. It's a practical application of Krashen's Input Hypothesis, which emphasises the importance of comprehensible input in language acquisition.

## 5. Keep a Weekly Word Chart

Keep a record, where you add new words each week.

Maintaining a chart encourages active engagement with new vocabulary. By writing words, their meanings, and using them in context, you're employing a multi-sensory approach to learning, which is proven to be more effective than passive reading or listening.

## 6. Use Context Clues

Employ context clues to deduce meanings of unknown words in English texts.

Using context clues to infer meanings helps in developing critical thinking and comprehension skills. This active engagement with text is supported by Constructivist Learning Theory, suggesting that learners construct knowledge through experiences.

## 7. Be an Actor!

Create or participate in word games that involve performing words or creating narratives.

Kinaesthetic learning, or learning by doing, is very effective, especially in language learning. Combining physical movement with vocabulary learning enhances memory and recall, as it involves more brain regions than just memorizing.

## 8. Be an Artist!

Draw, paint, or craft items related to new vocabulary you're learning.

Creative tasks like drawing or crafting related to new words stimulate different parts of the brain. This multimodal approach enhances the learning experience and aids in better retention and recall of vocabulary.
