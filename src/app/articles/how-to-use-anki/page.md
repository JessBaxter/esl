Anki is a program that simplifies the process of memorisation, offering greater efficiency than conventional study methods. This allows users to either significantly reduce study time or considerably increase the volume of information learned. Central to Anki are two concepts: active recall testing and spaced repetition, which, despite their long-standing presence in scientific literature, remain unfamiliar to many learners.

## What is Anki?

In Anki, a 'card' refers to a digital version of a paper flashcard, featuring a question-and-answer pair. Unlike physical flashcards, the question remains visible when the answer is revealed. For example, in studying basic chemistry, a question like "What is the chemical symbol for oxygen?" would display "O" upon revealing the answer. Users then inform Anki about their recall level, influencing the scheduling of future reviews.

Decks in Anki are designed to categorise content into broad study areas like English or Geography. While it might seem appealing to create many small decks for detailed organisation, such as "my geography book chapter 1" or "food verbs," this approach is generally discouraged. One key reason is that it can lead to recognising the order of cards, especially with older scheduler versions where new cards are introduced in the order of the decks. If you sequentially review each deck, you'll likely encounter related content together, like all "chapter 1" or "food verb" cards. This contextual cue can make it easier to guess answers, resulting in weaker memory formation. Effective recall in real-world situations demands retrieving information without such contextual hints, a skill that overly segmented decks might not sufficiently develop.

5. Repeat _steps 2-4_ for all your cards.
6. Click **Close** when you are finished making cards.

_If you close the **Add** card window, and you want to add more cards later, repeat_ Step 1 _above._

**Remember:** It is better to put all of your English learning cards into one deck, and not make many decks.
