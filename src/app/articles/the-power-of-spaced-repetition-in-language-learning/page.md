## What is Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is an important method, especially for language learning. By reviewing information at different times, you remember better for longer. It's more effective than just memorising.

The effectiveness of spaced repetition lies in its unique approach of combining repetitive learning with strategic intervals. This method ensures that information is revisited just when it begins to fade from memory, strengthening the retention process. It also facilitates the integration of new knowledge with what has already been learned, making it easier to recall in the future.

The foundation of spaced repetition is the [Ebbinghaus forgetting curve](https://e-student.org/ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve/), which illustrates how information is forgotten over time. This learning technique cleverly uses the curve to its advantage by scheduling reviews at intervals that prevent total forgetting, thus reinforcing the memory more strongly each time information is recalled after partial forgetting.

Research validates the superiority of spaced repetition over conventional learning methods. Studies have shown that increasing repetition intervals optimises memory retention. Spaced repetition not only improves memory but also alters brain connectivity, ensuring that learning is consolidated in long-term memory.

In the context of language learning, spaced repetition is particularly beneficial for vocabulary acquisition. Tools like paper flashcards, and digital applications such as [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), [Brainscape](https://www.brainscape.com/), and [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/), assist learners in organising and systematically reviewing new words. These methods provide a structured approach to vocabulary learning, aiding in better retention.

While spaced repetition excels in memorisation, it should be integrated with comprehensive language exposure. Comprehensible input, which involves understanding language usage in context, is key to language learning. Spaced repetition enhances this by ensuring that new vocabulary is not only learned but also remembered, making it a valuable component of any comprehensive language study program.

For effective implementation of spaced repetition, consistency in intervals and a well-planned study regimen are crucial. Balancing recall success and error rates ensures active engagement in the learning process. Persistence, even through challenging phases, is vital as it strengthens neural pathways. A distraction-free study environment complements the method, maximising learning outcomes.
