## How do we research a debate topic?

Being able to back up your claims with reputable sources is a key skill in winning any argument. In today's world where it's becoming increasingly more difficult to be able to determine fact from fiction (in part due to the accessibility of AI-generated content), knowing that the information you have can be trusted is vital.

### A List of some reliable sources

Here are some of my personal go-to sites when it comes to learning about some of these pretty complex topics. You'll need to use the site's **search** functionality to find articles of interest.

### An example (delivered by the 2nd speaker)

_Firstly, I would like to argue that_ social media isn't always good for our minds. _While it is true that_ it can help us feel connected, _this argument overlooks the fact that_ it can also make us feel sad or worried. _For instance_, when we see others looking happy online, we might feel left out or not good enough. _Some might argue that_ social media is a great way to share things, _but this fails to consider_ how it makes us compare ourselves to others all the time. _Additionally_, spending too much time on social media can make us feel stressed. _To clarify_, I'm not saying social media is all bad, but we need to be careful with how we use it. _In conclusion_, the problems with social media, like feeling sad or stressed, are bigger than the good parts.
