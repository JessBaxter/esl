# About jess.foo

**jess.foo** is more than just an English learning platform; it's your personal roadmapðŸ—º to conqueringðŸ’ª English, from the basics to advanced mastery. Created by a seasoned ELICOS teacher with nearly two decades of experience, this site is tailored for adults embarking on their English learning journey in AustraliaðŸ¦˜ 

## How to use this site

If you are studying English in Australia, you're probably attending one of the following classes:

- Beginner
- Elementary
- Pre-Intermediate
- Intermediate
- Upper Intermediate
- Advanced

These class names can be converted to a level on the [Common European Framework of Reference for Languages](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/table-1-cefr-3.3-common-reference-levels-global-scale) (CEFR):

- _Beginner_ is before A1, and not on the scale
- _Elementary_ is **A1**
- _Pre-Intermediate_ is **A2**
- _Intermediate_ is **B1**
- _Upper Intermediate_ is **B2**
- _Advanced_ is **C1**

Once you know your class or CEFR level, you can find appropriate learning materials in the site's navigation menu, under **Find Your Class**.

Each class/level is divided into 12 weeks, which compliment National Geographic Learning's [Life (2nd edition) series](https://www.eltngl.com/). This is the textbook my on-campus students are currently using, and is a useful resource to guide your language learning.
